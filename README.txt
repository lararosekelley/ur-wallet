README: BetterBB
Ty-Lucas Kelley

Better BlackBoard is a Chrome Extension designed to simplify the process of accessing and editing basic information on BlackBoard.

Current State
	Logs into BB
	Displays User's Name

End Goals
	Features
		-Log into BB once, and save information locally so that they are permanently logged in to BB unless they choose to sign out (which would then delete file)
		-Display information that is most useful:
			-User's name
			-Declining and URos balances
			-Classes registered for and current grades
			-Upcoming assignments/due dates
			-Ability to upload assignments easily by dragging and dropping into a "box" for each class
			-Anything else we deem cool or necessary
	Integration
		-I could easily see this becoming integrated into a suite of applications and extensions called "Better Rochester" or something like that. It would include:
			-Better BlackBoard
			-Better WebWork
			-Better CDCS
			-Better Registration
			-Better Buses
			-Better Dining
			-Better CCC???
