AngularJS URWallet

This is the URWallet extension using AngularJS. I don't really know how to use Angular that well so some critique would be appreciated.

How to Install and Run
-------------------------------
Clone the repo. Then,
	```Chrome --> Settings --> Extensions --> Developer Mode --> Load Unpacked Extension --> Find the URWalletChrome folder```
